## Project Structure

Derived from the [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md) project structure.
- `src/app/routes/` is renamed to `src/app/views/` since this is an SPA.
- `src/stores/` is renamed to `src/state/` to reflect Svelte's state management.
- `tests/` contains unit tests.
